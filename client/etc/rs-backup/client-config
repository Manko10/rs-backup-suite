# You can use the variables %h which will be replaced with the hostname
# of this machine and %u which will be replaced with your local username.
# If a global system backup is performed, %u will be 'root' for the global
# backup and the corresponding user for the individual home directories

# For systems that don't support it (e.g. Synology DSM), you may
# need to remove the --acls option
#
# The block size setting should avoid hangs when backing up larger

# If you need larger values, recompile rsync with MAX_BLOCK_SIZE
# set to an appropriate value.

# Configuration directory prefix relative to a user's home directory.
#
# Inside the prefix must be a file called "include-files"
# containing the patterns for matching files to include or exclude.
# The format is the same as the global 'include-files' config file
# and described in the FILTER RULES section of the rsync(1) man page.
# If no such file is found inside a home directory, it won't be backup up
#
# If TRANSFER_PROTOCOL is set to "rsync" the config prefix must also
# contain a file called "rsync-password.secret" with permissions 600.
#
# For global system backups, the config prefix is always /etc/rs-backup.
